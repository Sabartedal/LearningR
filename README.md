# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

- `data/`:
- `doc/`:
- `R/`:

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using `usethis::use_package("packagename")`
through the `DESCRIPTION` file, installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`LearningR.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_deps()

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

# Resource

For more information on this folder and file workflow and setup, check

documentation.
